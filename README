Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bootstrap::ShareDir::Module

This module allows one to load a "Module" styled "ShareDir" using a
"Bootstrap" mechanism so a distribution can use files in its own source
tree when building with itself.

This is very much like the "Bootstrap::lib" plugin in that it injects
libraries into @INC based on your existing source tree, or a previous
build you ran.

And it is syntactically like the "ModuleShareDirs" plugin.

Note that this is really only useful for self consuming *plugins* and
will have no effect on the "test" or "run" phases of your dist. ( For
that, you'll need "Test::File::ShareDir" ).
